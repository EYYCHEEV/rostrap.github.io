# Website
The website is compiled from markdown (`.md`) files, so anyone can help write documentation for this website! Click [here](https://github.com/RoStrap/rostrap.github.io/tree/master/docs) to visit the repository where the markdown files are kept. The [documentation for the Signal library](https://rostrap.github.io/Libraries/Events/Signal/) follows the format that will be standard.
